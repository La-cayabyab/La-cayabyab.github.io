Hello, my name is L.A. I am a passionate Data Scientist excited about the entire data science lifecycle -- from data model design, partnership with stakeholders in building KPIs, to deployment and maintenance of machine learning models.

My Data Science career started as a Business Analyst in fast-paced startup environments which enabled me to develop strong cross-functional communication, requirement elicitation, project management, and foundational data analytics skills.

I currently work as a Data Scientist in Brex supporting various areas: Customer Experience, Product Operations, Cash and Banking, Credit, Billing, and Collections/Servicing
